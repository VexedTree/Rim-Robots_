	<RR_EnergyNeedDescription>Energy is the amount of retained charge output from the internal reactor. If it hits zero, the persona will enter an inefficient low-power mode. If charge is not restored, hardware will eventually critically malfunction, and the persona will cease functioning.</RR_EnergyNeedDescription>
    <RR_MemoryNeed>Memory</RR_MemoryNeed>
	<RR_MemoryNeedDescription>Memory is the amount of time between each system defragment. Advanced personae must regularly enter a semi-comatose state to purge useless info from their AI cores to avoid memory overloads. If they go too long without it, they will involuntarily shutdown until excess memory is purged.</RR_MemoryNeedDescription>
