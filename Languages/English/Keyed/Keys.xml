	<RR.EnergyNeedDescription>Energy is the amount of retained charge output from the internal reactor. If it is hits zero, the persona will enter an inefficient low-power mode. If charge is not restored, hardware will eventually critically malfunction, and the persona will cease functioning.</RR.EnergyNeedDescription>

    <RR.MemoryNeed>Memory</RR.MemoryNeed>
	<RR.MemoryNeedDescription>Memory is the amount of time between each system defragment. Advanced units must regularly enter a semi-comatose state to purge useless info from their persona cores to avoid memory overloads.
