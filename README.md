# Rim-Robots_
Mod for the game Rimworld, by Ludeon Studios.

For those interested in the XML I've left multiple little tid-bits and notes to read through, with explanations on what certain things do where their initial purpose is unclear. 
I've also organized the #C side of things, with labels for what each block of code to explain what it does, and categorized types to hold whatever you want to prode/pick apart.

Hope it helps, and if anything just hit me up on Discord if you have any questions or stuff like that. Enjoy!
